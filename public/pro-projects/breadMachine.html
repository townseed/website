<h1>The Bread Machine</h1>
<p>Its a machine that makes bread. Or at least it used to.</p>
<p>&#160</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>I plan to re-write the driver code for a raspberry Pi Pico and install that as the controller in the machine.</p>
<p>&#160</p>
<h3>2023 recap</h3>
<p>As of now, the machine has lost its microcontrollers, but remains wired to be able to take inputs from one.</p>
<p>&#160</p>
<h3>Spring 2023</h3>
