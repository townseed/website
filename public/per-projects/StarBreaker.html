<h3>1/8/2024 - History of development so far</h3>
<p>It was Jan 3, I had been playing Twenty Minuites Till Dawn and I was thinking of what I would make if I were to make a game. I rembered playing bubble tanks, in particular bubble tanks 2 and how I liked the way that you could choose which direction you wanted to evolve your tank.</p>
<p>I had watched Gurren Lagan the week before and I got the idea to combine all of these ideas together and make a mecha rougelike.</p>
<p>I reached out to my friend Rowan Peters who was (and as of now still is) majoring in game design with the idea.</p>
<p>I've added the ideas that I've come up with to the github, and plan on coninuing work when I have more time, probably this summer.</p>
